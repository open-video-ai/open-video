# Getting Started

> **Status:** open-video is **v0 / planning**. There is no `pip install open-video` package yet —
> you run it from source. The CLI, core, and ComfyUI adapter are working; the heavy lifting
> (model inference) happens inside a local [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
> server that open-video drives over HTTP.

This guide takes you from an empty machine to your first open-video-generated clip.

---

## 1. What you need

| Requirement | Why | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Python 3.10+** | Run the open-video orchestrator | 3.11/3.12 recommended. The orchestrator itself is stdlib-only. |
| **Git** | Clone the repo | |
| **An NVIDIA GPU** | Run the H3 model | See the VRAM table below. ~10–12 GB VRAM is the practical floor for a usable H3 quant. |
| **NVIDIA drivers + CUDA** | ComfyUI inference | CUDA 12.x, current driver. |
| **ffmpeg** | Stitching shots + audio | `ffmpeg -version` should print a version. |
| **~30 GB free disk** | Model weights + outputs | The H3 weights alone are ~17–21 GB depending on quant. |

### GPU / VRAM cheat sheet (H3)

Pick the quant that fits your card (see [`docs/h3_ecosystem.md`](./h3_ecosystem.md) for the full
list and known issues):

| VRAM | H3 quant | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **8 GB** | NF4 | `DiffSynth-Studio/MiniMax-H3-NF4` (lowest entry point) |
| **~10 GB** | W4 ConvRot | `DmitryDB/MiniMax-H3-ComfyUI-Quants` |
| **~21 GB** (default) | INT8 ConvRot | Comfy-Org — proven on RTX 5090 |
| **~62 GB** | BF16 | full quality, multi-GPU only |

> Avoid **NVFP4** on RTX 5090 — it hits a known ComfyUI bug (#14157).

No NVIDIA GPU? open-video still plans and validates prompts, but generation needs a model
backend. A Mac port (`minimax-h3-mlx`) exists in the community but is not wired into the CLI yet.

---

## 2. Clone open-video

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robotlearning123/open-video.git
cd open-video
```

The orchestrator is pure Python and has **no third-party pip dependencies** — `core/`, `cli/`,
`engines/`, and `backends/` use only the Python standard library. So there is no
`requirements.txt` to install for open-video itself. You can sanity-check it right now:

```bash
python cli/open_video.py list-models
# Expected output: a table with the "h3" backend (MiniMax H3), modes t2v/i2v/flf2v, max 15.0s
```

If `list-models` prints the table, the orchestrator is healthy. The remaining steps set up the
**engine** (ComfyUI) and the **model weights** (H3) that actually render the frames.

---

## 3. Set up ComfyUI (the engine)

open-video is the **director**; ComfyUI is the **hands**. open-video talks to ComfyUI's HTTP API,
so install ComfyUI separately following its [official install guide](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

In short:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
cd ComfyUI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

ComfyUI brings in `torch`, `safetensors`, the scheduler, etc. — everything needed to actually run
the model. Keep note of the path to your `ComfyUI/` checkout; you will drop the H3 weights into
its `models/` folders next.

---

## 4. Download the H3 model weights

The default H3 settings in open-video use Comfy-Org's **INT8 ConvRot** quants (proven on the
RTX 5090). Download these four files from the [MiniMax H3 model card](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3)
and the linked Comfy-Org quant repos, and place them under `ComfyUI/models/`:

| File | Destination |
|---|---|
| `minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors` (diffusion model) | `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/` |
| `qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3_int8_convrot.safetensors` (text encoder) | `ComfyUI/models/text_encoders/` |
| `minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors` (video VAE) | `ComfyUI/models/vae/` |
| `minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32.safetensors` (audio VAE) | `ComfyUI/models/vae/` |

> Low on VRAM? Swap the two INT8 files for the NF4 quant (`DiffSynth-Studio/MiniMax-H3-NF4`) and
> pass `--lowvram` when you start ComfyUI. The fastest path (4-step Turbo LoRA + Dual-Clock
> sampler, ~5× faster) is documented in [`docs/h3_ecosystem.md`](./h3_ecosystem.md).

---

## 5. Start ComfyUI

From your ComfyUI checkout:

```bash
python main.py --listen --lowvram --use-sage-attention
```

ComfyUI prints a server URL, by default **`http://127.0.0.1:8188`**. Leave it running in its own
terminal — open-video will connect to it.

Verify open-video can reach it:

```bash
# from the open-video repo root
python cli/open_video.py "anything" --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` validates the prompt, builds the plan, checks ComfyUI health, and exits **without
generating**. If you see `--dry-run: prompt + plan validated`, the stack is wired correctly.

If it errors with `ComfyUI not reachable at http://127.0.0.1:8188`, either ComfyUI isn't running
or the URL differs — point open-video at it with `--server` or the `OPEN_VIDEO_COMFYUI` env var.

---

## 6. Generate your first video

All commands run from the **open-video repo root**. The default model is `h3` and the default
ComfyUI server is `http://127.0.0.1:8188` (override with `OPEN_VIDEO_MODEL` and
`OPEN_VIDEO_COMFYUI`).

### a) Single-shot, text-to-video (simplest)

```bash
python cli/open_video.py "a neon koi swimming through rain, slow dolly" \
  --duration 8 --output output/koi.mp4
```

H3's per-shot ceiling is **15 s**. At `--duration 15` or below, open-video generates a single
shot using your prompt verbatim.

### b) Image-to-video (animate a still)

```bash
python cli/open_video.py "the diver turns to face the light" \
  --mode i2v --first-frame start.png --duration 6 --output output/diver.mp4
```

`--mode i2v` requires `--first-frame`. Supplying `--first-frame` to a plain `t2v` prompt
auto-upgrades shot 1 to i2v.

### c) First-and-last-frame interpolation

```bash
python cli/open_video.py "the cyclist opens her umbrella in the rain" \
  --mode flf2v --first-frame frame_a.png --last-frame frame_b.png --duration 8
```

`--mode flf2v` requires **both** `--first-frame` and `--last-frame`.

### d) Multi-shot film (longer than 15 s)

```bash
python cli/open_video.py "a 90-second chase across a stormy harbour at dusk" \
  --duration 90 --output output/chase.mp4
```

Durations above 15 s trigger a **multi-shot plan**: open-video splits the film into ≤15 s shots
and chains them so each shot's first frame is the previous shot's last frame (FL2VA continuity).

> **Honest v0 caveat:** multi-shot plans currently use template prompts and need an LLM planner
> (`Planner(llm_fn=...)`) to author per-shot prompts. The CLI will print a note telling you this.
> For authored single takes, stay at `--duration <= 15`.

---

## 7. Useful CLI subcommands

```bash
python cli/open_video.py list-models          # show discovered backends under backends/
python cli/open_video.py list-presets         # browse the prompt recipes in library/prompts/
python cli/open_video.py "..." --dry-run      # plan + validate, no GPU spent
python cli/open_video.py "..." --seed 42      # reproducible; applied as seed+i across shots
```

The full flag list:

```bash
python cli/open_video.py --help
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `ComfyUI not reachable at …` | Start ComfyUI first; or pass `--server <url>` / set `OPEN_VIDEO_COMFYUI`. |
| `unknown model 'h3'` | Run from the repo root so `backends/h3/` is importable. `list-models` must show `h3`. |
| OOM during generation | Drop to a smaller H3 quant (NF4), start ComfyUI with `--lowvram`, reduce `--duration`. |
| Audio popping / artifact | Try the Dual-Clock Euler sampler (see [`h3_ecosystem.md`](./h3_ecosystem.md)). |
| Wide shots corrupt faces | Known H3 issue (Comfy-Org #30). Tighten framing in the prompt or use i2v with a clean reference. |
