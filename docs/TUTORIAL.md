## 1. What is OpenVideo today?

**OpenVideo** is open-source video generation. In **v0.0.1** that means:

1. **Local MiniMax H3** on your machine via ComfyUI — `install` · `pull` · `status` · `run`
2. **Agent skill harness** (`skill/h3-video`) so coding agents can craft official 3-field H3
   prompts and generate high-quality short clips on **your** GPU

It is **not** (yet): a free cloud render service, a polished desktop app store install, a live
vision quality loop that always re-renders bad takes, or a finished multi-minute film director.

> **In one line:** *Open video models on your GPU — with an agent-friendly harness.*

<details>
<summary><b>What does "open-source" mean for me?</b></summary>

Apache 2.0: free to use, modify, and share. You run generation on hardware you control. There is
**no** hosted free GPU product today. Optional cloud convenience may come later; the core stays
open and local-first.
</details>

> **Screenshots:** TBD — UI and gallery still land; this tutorial uses commands you can run now.

---

## 2. Install (primary paths)

Pick **one**. Real generation needs an **NVIDIA GPU** (about 8–10 GB VRAM practical floor for a
small quant; ~21 GB+ comfortable for INT8).

| Path | Best for | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **A. One-line install** | Fastest setup | Linux/macOS terminal + NVIDIA GPU + disk (~60 GB) |
| **B. Clone + scripts** | Developers already in the repo | Same GPU + Python 3.10+ |
| **C. Browser `/try`** | Seeing the *idea* of the product | Browser only — **mockup, not cloud generate** |

Full detail: [`getting-started.md`](./getting-started.md) · [`QUICKSTART.md`](./QUICKSTART.md).

### Option A — One-line install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://open-video.ai/install | bash
```

Windows (PowerShell), when supported by the host script:

```powershell
irm https://open-video.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer sets up ComfyUI, downloads H3 weights (resumable), and prints next commands. Prefer
flags from the script’s `--help` / `--self-test` when debugging.

There are **no** shipping primary installers named `OpenVideo-Setup.exe`, `OpenVideo.dmg`, or
`OpenVideo.AppImage` today. Use curl/clone, not a fake desktop package.

### Option B — Clone + CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-video-ai/open-video.git
cd open-video
# optional: bash scripts/install.sh
python -m open_video list-models
python -m open_video pull h3 --check-only
python -m open_video status
```

You still need a running ComfyUI with H3 weights (installer or manual layout under your lab /
ComfyUI `models/` paths). See `getting-started.md`.

### Option C — Website `/try` (mockup only)

[open-video.ai/try](https://open-video.ai/try) is a **static browser mockup** of the director
flow. It does **not** render free cloud video on OpenVideo GPUs. For real clips, use A or B on a
local NVIDIA GPU.

---

## 3. Make your first video

### Step 1 — Health checks

```bash
open-video status
# or: python -m open_video status
# dry-run validates without a full render:
open-video "a neon-lit koi fish swimming slowly through rain" --dry-run
```

Confirm ComfyUI is up (default `http://127.0.0.1:8188`) and weights are present.

### Step 2 — Write a visual prompt

Be specific: subject + setting + lighting + camera.

> *a neon-lit koi fish swimming slowly through falling rain, soft reflections on wet asphalt,
> gentle camera dolly forward, cinematic, moody*

For best H3 quality, agents should use the official **3-field** grammar
(`backends/h3/PROMPT_GRAMMAR.md` / `skill/h3-video`).

### Step 3 — Generate

```bash
open-video run "a neon-lit koi fish swimming slowly through falling rain, soft reflections on wet asphalt, gentle camera dolly forward, cinematic, moody" \
  --duration 8
# battle-tested agent path:
# python scripts/h3_agent.py --prompt "$(cat my_prompt.txt)" --duration 8
```

Single shots are typically **4–15 seconds** (model ceiling). Longer targets need multi-shot
orchestration (section 5) — still partial in v0.0.1.

### Step 4 — Find the mp4

Outputs land under the paths the CLI / ComfyUI print (often `output/`). Re-run with a new seed or
tighter prompt if the take is off.

---

## 4. Use presets (recipe files)

**Presets** in the repo are YAML **coherence recipes** under
[`library/coherence_recipes/`](../library/coherence_recipes/) — templates for film *types*
(cinematic short, product ad, social clip, …). They are starting points for planners and humans,
not a finished “pick a preset in a GUI and get a commercial” product.

```bash
# when wired in your checkout:
python -m open_video list-presets
# or open the YAML files directly
ls library/coherence_recipes/
```

Copy a recipe, edit shot structure / duration, and feed prompts into `run` / `h3_agent.py`. A
polished preset picker UI is future work.

---

## 5. Multi-shot / long film (honest status)

Models cap a **single shot** around **15s**. Longer pieces need: plan shots → generate each →
chain last-frame → first-frame (FL2VA) → stitch with ffmpeg.

**v0.0.1 status:**

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| Single-shot H3 generate | **Shipped** |
| Multi-shot scripts / pipeline scaffold | **Partial** (`scripts/h3_multishot.py`, `core/pipeline.py`) |
| Full autonomous multi-minute director | **Not shipped** — design target |

Preview planning without GPU when supported:

```bash
open-video "a 90-second chase across a stormy harbour at dusk" --duration 90 --dry-run
```

Do not treat dry-run or scaffold code as proof of a finished long-film product.

---

## 6. Community LoRAs (planned UX)

A **LoRA** is a small style/identity adapter (`.safetensors`) that can sit on H3.

**Today:** drop standard H3 LoRAs into ComfyUI’s `models/loras/` and use them in workflows.

**Planned:** gallery, `open-video lora pull`, and one-click `--lora name@strength` UX — documented
as a target in [`library-and-loras.md`](./library-and-loras.md). Do not expect a full community
marketplace in v0.0.1.

Contribution shape when you train one: recipe markdown + off-repo weights + consent rules
(`templates/lora_recipe.md`).

---

## 7. The quality loop (design target)

**Idea:** generate → extract frames → vision-judge vs prompt → refine / best-of-N → keep the take.

This is **core product IP we are building toward**, inspired by research patterns (e.g. VISTA-style
judge + refine). In v0.0.1:

- `core/judge.py` exists as a **scaffold**
- Without a wired `vision_fn`, assessment may **PASS by default** (hook ready; not a live critic)
- Agents should still **validate prompts** and re-run manually when quality is poor

Do **not** market OpenVideo as “the first open project that already ships a live quality loop.”
It is a design target with early scaffolding.

---

## 8. Share your work

Easiest contributions (no coding required for some):

1. **Prompt recipes** — good 3-field H3 prompts under `library/prompts/`
2. **Coherence recipes** — YAML film templates under `library/coherence_recipes/`
3. **Issues / PRs** on GitHub when the tree is available to you

There is **no** public Discord as a required community path. Prefer:

- Site: [https://open-video.ai](https://open-video.ai)
- GitHub Issues on `open-video-ai/open-video`

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [`docs/COMMUNITY.md`](./COMMUNITY.md).

## 9. Troubleshooting & glossary

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Clip ignores the prompt** | Use the official 3-field grammar; name subject + camera + visible detail. |
| **Glitchy / broken frames** | New seed; shorter duration; lower resolution; re-validate prompt. |
| **OOM / CUDA errors** | Smaller quant (NF4/W4), `--lowvram`, shorter clip. |
| **No NVIDIA GPU** | You can use the `/try` mockup only; real gen is local GPU-first. |
| **`/try` didn’t “generate”** | Expected — browser mockup, not free cloud GPU. |
| **Slow** | Warm runs still minutes per short clip on consumer cards; see `docs/h3/BENCHMARK.md`. |

### Glossary

- **Prompt** — text describing the video (prefer H3 3-field for quality).
- **Shot / clip** — one continuous render, typically ≤15s on H3.
- **Film (multi-shot)** — several shots planned and stitched (partial support).
- **LoRA** — small adapter for style/identity.
- **Judge / quality loop** — design: auto score and refine takes (scaffold today).
- **ComfyUI** — open render engine OpenVideo drives over HTTP.
- **H3 (MiniMax H3)** — default open video model; strong open Arena placement.
